# Victoria Traffic and Accident Visualization

This project uses **Tableau** to visualize and analyze traffic conditions and accident data in the state of **Victoria**, Australia. The goal is to provide insights into traffic patterns, accident hotspots, and related trends, helping both city planners and the general public better understand road safety and traffic dynamics.

## Project Overview

[![Watch the video](https://github.com/HowieSihanDong/Victorian-Traffic-Insights-Tableau-Visualization/blob/e15dd17818cef3c2d5f217f0a352c3728621a761/pic)]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepository/main/assets/video.mp4](https://github.com/HowieSihanDong/Victorian-Traffic-Insights-Tableau-Visualization/blob/e15dd17818cef3c2d5f217f0a352c3728621a761/pre_final.mov))



In this project, I utilized publicly available traffic data and accident statistics from various sources to create interactive visualizations. The dashboards are designed to provide an intuitive way to explore traffic flow, accident frequencies, and correlations with factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and road types.

### Key Features

- **Traffic Flow Analysis**: Visualizes the traffic flow across different regions of Victoria, including peak hours and congestion hotspots.
- **Accident Mapping**: Pinpoints accident locations, highlighting high-risk areas with visual clustering techniques.
- **Trend Analysis**: Investigates trends in accidents over time, including seasonality and time-of-day patterns.
- **Correlations**: Explores potential correlations between traffic conditions and accident occurrences, including weather conditions and traffic density.

## Data Sources

The project uses publicly available data from the following sources:
- **Victoria State Government Traffic Data**
- **Victoria Police Accident Database**
- **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)**
- **Weather Data (from open APIs)**

## Tools and Technologies

- **Tableau**: Used for creating the interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Excel/CSV Files**: Data is cleaned and preprocessed in Excel or CSV format before being imported into Tableau.
- **Python/R** (Optional): For additional data processing or analysis if needed (not part of the main Tableau dashboards).

## Installation

To interact with or modify the Tableau workbooks locally, you will need:

1. **Tableau Desktop**: Download and install [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) if you don't have it already.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/victoria-traffic-accident-visualization.git
    ```
3. **Open the Tableau Workbook**: Open the `.twb` file in Tableau Desktop to explore the visualizations.

## Usage

Once you open the Tableau workbook, you can interact with the following features:

- **Explore Traffic Patterns**: Use the filters to adjust the view based on time, location, or traffic volume.
- **View Accident Hotspots**: Click on different regions on the map to see the accident data associated with specific areas.
- **Time Trends**: Use the timeline to analyze accident trends over different periods (e.g., by day, week, or month).
